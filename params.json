{"name":"Openxlt","tagline":"","body":"**NOTICE: There are known bugs that may cause OpenXLT to incorrectly convert XLTek data at this time. We are actively working to fix these issues.**\r\n\r\nOpenXLT\r\n=======\r\n*OpenXLT* is a free, open-source C++ program for the conversion of EEG data from the Natus XLTek file format to formats readable by other programs. Currently, only the .mat file format is supported for exporting.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nFor the compilation to work correctly, your system must have Matlab installed and the proper Environment variables set. See [this page](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/compiling-engine-applications-with-the-mex-command.html) for instructions.\r\n\r\nOn a UNIX system, execute the following:\r\n```\r\n$ ./main <dirname>\r\n```\r\nwhere dirname contains the XLTek binary files to convert. Currently, the dirname must have a trailing slash or you will get an error.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, open a command prompt and CD into the directory with your binary and execute:\r\n```\r\nmain.exe <dirname>\r\n```\r\nIn this case, the dirname must NOT have a trailing backslash. This limitation will be fixed in future versions.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nHaving trouble with OpenXLT? File a bug report.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
